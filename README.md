#### "Half a century ago, the great environmental awakening that swept Florida and the nation helped stop the Cross-Florida Barge Canal.

#### But the project’s last remnant, Rodman Dam on the Ocklawaha River, still stands, entangled in political discourse as residents continue to use the area recreationally. The aging dam threatens more than ecosystems.

#### State officials acknowledge that, amid worsening storms and extreme rains associated with climate change, the dam is now at a high risk of breaching—endangering hundreds of rural homeowners who live nearby.

#### Officials haven't yet notified families of the risk, and activists worry about the dam causing potential loss of not only marine life but human life as well if the dam isn't fixed or taken down."

#### WUFT built this application in supplement to the main reporting and writing done by Alan Halaly.
